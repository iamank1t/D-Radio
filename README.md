A Decentralised Radio For Common Folks. D-RADIO is the project created to help those people writing and speaking about their life, culture and nationality in their language.The man behind this idea [Dcrazy](www.steemit.com/@dcrazy). [iamankit](www.steemit.com/@iamankit) is helping him in this project as Lead Developer of the project. [@steepshot](https://steemit.com/@steepshot) development team will be working on this project as they find it interesting. They are a team consisting of 20 members who are really great and they agreed to develop this project.

# Why D-Radio is helpful ?
Radio was one of the Revolutionary Technologies of 20th Century which was invented by Guglielmo Marconi in 1894. It was one of the main reason for the Development of Nationalism during the World Wars. It is one piece of technology that created a whole branch of Electronics but has very little Appreciation In the 21st Century.

As there are many people coming to Steemit from different countries, they like to post blogs in their own language and there are also normal people who don't know English coming to this platform looking for some earnings. Those people know how to talk in their language and also have life experiences of many years or decades.

D-RADIO is the project created to help those people writing and speaking about their life, culture and nationality in their language.So there are more than 6500 languages in the world. Of them at least 250 languages can be considered as major languages speaker by around 100000 people. If they come to Steemit and don't know any languages, they can just talk about what they want to tell instead of trying to learn English and also this will be helpful for Common People to use Steemit instead of just going away from it.
