# What is D-Radio
A Decentralised Radio For Common Folks. D-RADIO is the project created to help those people writing and speaking about their life, culture and nationality in their language.The man behind this idea [Dcrazy](www.steemit.com/@dcrazy). [iamankit](www.steemit.com/@iamankit) is helping him in this project as Lead Developer of the project. [@steepshot](https://steemit.com/@steepshot) development team will be working on this project as they find it interesting. They are a team consisting of 20 members who are really great and they agreed to develop this project.

# Why D-Radio is helpful ?
Radio was one of the Revolutionary Technologies of 20th Century which was invented by Guglielmo Marconi in 1894. It was one of the main reason for the Development of Nationalism during the World Wars. It is one piece of technology that created a whole branch of Electronics but has very little Appreciation In the 21st Century.

As there are many people coming to Steemit from different countries, they like to post blogs in their own language and there are also normal people who don't know English coming to this platform looking for some earnings. Those people know how to talk in their language and also have life experiences of many years or decades.

D-RADIO is the project created to help those people writing and speaking about their life, culture and nationality in their language.So there are more than 6500 languages in the world. Of them at least 250 languages can be considered as major languages speaker by around 100000 people. If they come to Steemit and don't know any languages, they can just talk about what they want to tell instead of trying to learn English and also this will be helpful for Common People to use Steemit instead of just going away from it.

# Roadmap of D-Radio
As currently our team researching best possible ways to implement a safe a secure broadcasting system for users and the team almost completed their research. Soon [iamankit](www.steemit.com/@iamankit) will start development of web and iOS version of D-Radio. As the project is big and we also sort of funding, so we decided to launch the project in modules. We created a roadmap for D-Radio :-
* Module 1 - This module is initial release module of project. In this module we make D-Radio live for users to use with basic functionalities. In this module we implement steemconnect, so that users can login with their steem account. We provide basic broadcasting system for users with live audio session support. Users can create a new audio session or join any running live audio session. Language support in this module is English.
* Module 2 - This is next module which will be launch after some time of module 1. In this module we will add 2 more languages for users. We also implement comments feature in this module, so that users can interact with each other while listening audio session.
* Module 3 - In this module we will add record audio feature for users, so that they can record their audio session and make it live whenever they want. We also add 2 more languages in app for user fisiability.
* Module 4 - In this module we will add live video session for users, so that they can share their thoughts with other users more easily. In this module we also implement reputation system for users. This system gives users a different value among other users. We also implement a Request session features in which users can request other users for a audio/video session.
* Module 5 - In this module we implement download session functionality, so that users can download any session and watch or listen it after also. Another feature we will add in this module is premium session, in this feature users can request one on one session by paying small fees in SBD with other user because sometimes it will be difficult to express your thoughts when there are too many users in a session.

* Module 6 - In this module we will make app more localized by adding more languages support.

These are some modules which our team planning to launch as soon as possible. Many more things are also in our roadmap like launching android app, monetization and much more features. But as we all know to make a project great money also needed with effort. We funding project from our side as much we can but that funding is not too much so we also seeking for investors to help us in making D-Radio a revolutionary project.
